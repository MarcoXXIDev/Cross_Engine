uh hi so heres a tutorial of how to make a few stuff in this engine :)
btw a LOT of shit has changed, and the engine is almost as easy as Modding
Plus at this point

*CUSTOM CHARACTERS*
right now you can't add GF or BF as easily, this is just for enemies like Dad
1. go to assets/shared/images/characters and add a folder with your character's
name in lowercase
2. inside that folder add the spritesheet and xml of the character, rename them
to 'char'
3. go to assets/preload/images/characters and add a folder with your character's
name in lowercase again
4. add your icon png (dimensions should be 300 x 150) and rename it to 'icons'
5. go to assets/preload/data/characters and yet again add a folder with your
character's name in lowercase
6. copy + paste the char.txt file from 'test' and add it to your character's 
folder
7. follow the steps in the assets/preload/data/characters folder

*CUSTOM SONGS*
1. go to assets/songs and add a folder with your song name in lowercase
(if there are anyspaces, replace the space with "-")
2. add in the instrumental and vocals, renaming them "Inst" and "Voices" 
respectively (files must be .ogg)
3. go to assets/preload/data/songs and add a folder with the same name 
as the folder you made in assets/songs
4. copy + paste the "song-template.json" file into your own song folder
and rename it to the folder's name
5. copy + paste the json file and add "-hard" and "-easy" to the ends
(if you want hard and easy difficulties)
6. to add them in the menus, follow the "adding-songs" tutorial in the
assets/preload/data file
